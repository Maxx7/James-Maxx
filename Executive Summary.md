#Executive Summary

## Problem
The problems here are that the manage code stream has too many work load, the corporate manager needs a policy setup and developer needs to receive feedbacks from what he/she sent. 

This project is developed to address the issues about open source software which is inclouded in companies as internal project, some companies are thinking about getting involved with theird party. also to avoid being sued by law, a company must cope to the regulations established by the softwareâ€™s license when including the third party code into its projects. In addition, the software may have vulnerabilities attached to it, this system is designed to help managers to get and analyze important information about open source software.


## Solution
The solution of the problems will be breaking down Manage Code Stream into three different processes, and setup a policy information process and policy database for corporate manager, and developer will receive feedbacks from NIST, license control and corporate manager after one or couple processes.

Using open source is more beneficial for the project, Our project CPE reports will also be bundled with all the Common Vulunerabilities and Exposures reports for all of our included packages.a system designed for proper communications and dataflows between our managers and developers. The main bridge between the managers and developers is the Software Package Data exchange tool. which generates reports for our managers as existing software is added and used by the developers. With these tools at our disposal, we are building the best and safest.
