#Executive Summary

## Problem
The problems here are that the manage code stream has too many work load, the corporate manager needs a policy setup and developer needs to receive feedbacks from what he/she sent. 




## Solution
The solution of the problems will be breaking down Manage Code Stream into three different processes, and setup a policy information process and policy database for corporate manager, and developer will receive feedbacks from NIST, license control and corporate manager after one or couple processes.
