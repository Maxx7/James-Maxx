#Executive Summary

## Problem
The problems here is that the manage code stream has too many work load, the corporate manager needs a policy setup and developer needs to receive feedbacks from what he/she sent. 


## Solution
The solution of the problems will be break down Manage Code Stream into three different processes, and setup a policy information process and policy database for corporate manager, and developer will reveive feedbacks from NIST, license control and corporate manager after one or couple processes.
